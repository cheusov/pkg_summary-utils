Version 0.6.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Wed,  7 May 2008 23:07:00 +0300

   README file added. There are available a few examples how to use
   all these tools separately and together . You can use it as a
   titorial.

Version 0.6.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Wed,  7 May 2008 21:53:35 +0300

   NEW tool: pkg_grep_summary
     Run 'pkg_grep_summary -h' for a documentation.

Version 0.5.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Mon,  5 May 2008 01:00:43 +0300

   FIXED: pkg_update_summary fails under Linux, Solaris, Interix and
   probably other OSes when there are no binary packages in a specified
   directory.  This happens because xargs works differently on
   NetBSD/FreeBSD and Linux/Solaris/Interix. In NetBSD/FreeBSD xargs's
   command is NOT run at all when there is no input, while on L/S/I it is
   run once without arguments and (pkg_info -X in our case) fails.

   DESCR improved

   Minor fixes in documentation ans NEWS

Version 0.5.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 27 Apr 2008 14:37:46 +0300

   Lots of tasks from TODO are implemented.

   pkg_src_fetch_var:
      - minor fixes in comments
      - new options -h|--help for use message
      - new options -f|--fields|-v|--vars for specifying a list of fields
        to be generated. By default PKGNAME and PKPATH
        are generated as earlier versions did.

        Example:
          echo 'wip/distbb' | \
          pkg_src_fetch_var -f='PKGNAME PKGPATH COMMENT MAINTAINER'

      - bmake '+=' operator is also supported

   pkg_src_summary:
      - new options -h|--help for use message
      - new options -f|--fields for specifying a list of fields
        to be generated. By default PKGNAME and PKPATH
        are generated as earlier versions did.
      - 'print-summary-data' pkgsrc target is not used anymore.
        Instead, variable's values are obtained directly by bmake.

        Side effect/incompatibility: NOTFOR and ONLYFOR are set to
        <empty_string> instead of 'any' string in case
        NOT_FOR_PLATFORM and ONLY_FOR_PLATFORM are not specified.

   pkg_micro_src_summary:
      - new options -f|--fields for specifying a list of fields
        to be generated. By default PKGNAME and PKPATH
        are generated as earlier versions did.

        Example:
          pkg_micro_src_summary -f 'PKGNAME PKGPATH COMMENT MAINTAINER' \
                                   lang/lua wip/distbb
      - In case pkg_src_fetch_var failes pkg_micro_src_summary fallbacks
        to pkg_src_summary.

Version 0.4.6, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 13 Apr 2008 14:56:41 +0300

   fix for pkg_summary4view: doesn't depend on input fields order.
   fix for pkg_src_summary: PKGNAME and PKGPATH are printed first.

Version 0.4.5, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 13 Apr 2008 00:43:22 +0300

   Both pkg_micro_src_summary and pkg_src_summary generate
   nicely formatted bmake failures to stderr.
   (will be used by future versions of distbb)

      - pkg_refresh_summary.1

Version 0.4.2, by Aleksey Cheusov, Wed,  9 Apr 2008 00:34:58 +0300

   pkg_src_fetch_var:
      - read PKGPATHs instead of Makefile filenames.
        In order to Makefiles from PKGPATH, PKGSRCDIR environment
        variable is used (/usr/pkgsrc by default).
      - TAB character is used as a fields separator instead of SPC

   pkg_micro_src_summary:
      - added options: -h|--help|-f|--fields
        -f|--fields is for specifying fields to be included
        to the summary, PKGNAME and PKGPATH by default

Version 0.4.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Wed,  9 Apr 2008 23:14:03 +0300
