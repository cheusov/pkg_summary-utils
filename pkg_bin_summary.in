pkg_bin_summary - wrapper for 'pkg_info -X' that outputs
  build information and installation information
  variables as well some special variables for installed
  or binary packages,
  e.g. ASSIGNMENTS (settings to build multivariant packages) and
  REQUIREDBY. By default it is equivalent to pkg_info -Xa.

       pkg_bin_summary [OPTIONS] [-- [PKG_INFO_ARGS]] [packages...]
OPTIONS:
