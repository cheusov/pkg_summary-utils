.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
builds micro summary information about source packages specified in
arguments or read from stdin (one package per line).  The word micro
means that only PKGNAME and PKGPATH fields are generated. Format of
this summary is the same as used in pkg_summary.gz built from binary
packages. Fields (PKGNAME, PKGPATH, DEPENDS etc.) are very similar but
not fully the same. The main advantage of this utility is that is
works DRAMMATICALLY faster than pkg_src_summary in most cases.  This
is possible because special hack is used (only when it is possible!)
to fetch PKGNAME instead of running make. And for ~90% of all packages
(pkgsrc + wip) it is possible to use this hack. So
pkg_micro_src_summary works approximately 10 times faster than
pkg_src_summary.
