Version 0.11.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 14 Jun 2008 15:33:06 +0300

   pkg_src_summary:

      -d, -D and -A options for generating summary of the specified
      packages and their dependancies.  -d is for DEPENDS
      dependancies, -D is for BUILD_DEPENDS and -A is for both. See
      pkg_src_summary(1) for details.

Version 0.10.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 14 Jun 2008 13:30:04 +0300

   added: pkg_summary-utils(7) that describes what pkg_summary-utils
   project is. All tools refer to it in its manual pages and
   pkg_summary-utils(7) refers to manual pages of all tools.

   pkg_src_summary:

      a list of fields listed in -f|--fields option may be separated
      by comma, not only space.

      PSS_OPTIONS environment variable specifies default options to be
      placed in front of any explicit options. See man page for the
      sample.

      -a and -r options added for adding and removing the specified
      fields to/from the list of fields generated by default.
      See man page for the samples.

   pkg_update_src_summary:

      a list of fields listed in -f|--fields option may be separated
      by comma, not only space.

Version 0.9.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 14 Jun 2008 10:38:55 +0300

   ADDED: CVS_CHECKSUM field to pkg_src_summary. This gives a way to
   compare two pkgsrc trees by comparing their pkg_src_summaries
   comparing not only an information about package versions but also
   an information about CVS files and their revisions.

      new script added: 'cvs_checksum' that analyses local cvs
      repository and lists all files in it with their revisions and,
      optionally, calculates a checksum for all this. Run
      'cvs_checksum -h' for more information. CKSUM environment
      variable sets a checksum program, by default, standard 'cksum'.

      pkg_src_summary can generate new field: CVS_CHECKSUM, a checksum
      calculated by 'cvs_checksum' program for a package. By default 
      CVS_CHECKSUM is NOT generated.

      'pkg_cmp_summary -c' prints '!' (this means "not equal") for
      packages with the same versions but different CVS_CHECKSUM provided
      that CVS_CHECKSUM is set in both compared packages.

Version 0.8.0, by Aleksey Cheusov

   FIXED: pkg_src_summary pkgpath

   pkg_summary4view:

      DESCRIPTION, PLIST, PROVIDES and REQUIRES fields now look
      better. "FIELD_NAME:" is not followed by any data on the same
      line.  Data are displayed on the next lines.

      Multilined DEPENDS field (pkg_summary(5) from binary packages)
      now looks nicer - just like in case pkg_src_summary

      CONFLICTS field is processed just like DEPENDS

      Fields with values (DEPENDS - noe dependancies, NOTFOR - no
      restrictions etc.) are not output at all.

   pkg_src_summary:

      added option -p|--make-plist for using 'bmake plist'
      instead 'cat PLIST'. @directives are removed.

Version 0.7.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 10 May 2008 12:43:07 +0300

   pkg_src_summary is now "distributed" tool, i.e. it can build
   src_summary using several processes or machines. 
      Examples:

      # for SMP machine
      env PSS_SLAVES=+5 pkg_src_summary ...

      # for machines in a network
      env PSS_SLAVES='host1 host2 host3' \
          PSS_PPERS=5 \
          PSS_TRANSPORT=/usr/bin/ssh pkg_src_summary ...

      PSS_PPERS variable sets a number of packages per slave that
      are built at once, defaults to 10.

   pkg_src_summary: PSS_FIELDS overrides the default
   list of generated fields

   pkg_update_src_summary: -i|--fields options specify a list of
   generated fields.

Version 0.6.2, by Aleksey Cheusov

   grepping functionality of pkg_grep_summary has been moved to a
   separate file pkg_grep_summary.awk.  Similar code fragments found
   in pkg_refresh_summary and pkg_update_src_summary use
   pkg_grep_summary.awk now.

Version 0.6.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Wed,  7 May 2008 23:07:00 +0300

   README file added. There are available a few examples how to use
   all these tools separately and together . You can use it as a
   titorial.

Version 0.6.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Wed,  7 May 2008 21:53:35 +0300

   NEW tool: pkg_grep_summary
     Run 'pkg_grep_summary -h' for a documentation.

Version 0.5.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Mon,  5 May 2008 01:00:43 +0300

   FIXED: pkg_update_summary fails under Linux, Solaris, Interix and
   probably other OSes when there are no binary packages in a specified
   directory.  This happens because xargs works differently on
   NetBSD/FreeBSD and Linux/Solaris/Interix. In NetBSD/FreeBSD xargs's
   command is NOT run at all when there is no input, while on L/S/I it is
   run once without arguments and (pkg_info -X in our case) fails.

   DESCR improved

   Minor fixes in documentation ans NEWS

Version 0.5.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 27 Apr 2008 14:37:46 +0300

   Lots of tasks from TODO are implemented.

   pkg_src_fetch_var:
      - minor fixes in comments
      - new options -h|--help for use message
      - new options -f|--fields|-v|--vars for specifying a list of fields
        to be generated. By default PKGNAME and PKPATH
        are generated as earlier versions did.

        Example:
          echo 'wip/distbb' | \
          pkg_src_fetch_var -f='PKGNAME PKGPATH COMMENT MAINTAINER'

      - bmake '+=' operator is also supported

   pkg_src_summary:
      - new options -h|--help for use message
      - new options -f|--fields for specifying a list of fields
        to be generated. By default PKGNAME and PKPATH
        are generated as earlier versions did.
      - 'print-summary-data' pkgsrc target is not used anymore.
        Instead, variable's values are obtained directly by bmake.

        Side effect/incompatibility: NOTFOR and ONLYFOR are set to
        <empty_string> instead of 'any' string in case
        NOT_FOR_PLATFORM and ONLY_FOR_PLATFORM are not specified.

   pkg_micro_src_summary:
      - new options -f|--fields for specifying a list of fields
        to be generated. By default PKGNAME and PKPATH
        are generated as earlier versions did.

        Example:
          pkg_micro_src_summary -f 'PKGNAME PKGPATH COMMENT MAINTAINER' \
                                   lang/lua wip/distbb
      - In case pkg_src_fetch_var failes pkg_micro_src_summary fallbacks
        to pkg_src_summary.

Version 0.4.6, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 13 Apr 2008 14:56:41 +0300

   fix for pkg_summary4view: doesn't depend on input fields order.
   fix for pkg_src_summary: PKGNAME and PKGPATH are printed first.

Version 0.4.5, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 13 Apr 2008 00:43:22 +0300

   Both pkg_micro_src_summary and pkg_src_summary generate
   nicely formatted bmake failures to stderr.
   (will be used by future versions of distbb)

Version 0.4.4, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 12 Apr 2008 19:53:22 +0300

   lots of fixes and improvements in manual pages
   minors fixes in utilities

Version 0.4.3, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 12 Apr 2008 18:00:50 +0300

   added:
      - pkg_list_all_pkgs.1
      - pkg_refresh_summary.1

Version 0.4.2, by Aleksey Cheusov, Wed,  9 Apr 2008 00:34:58 +0300

   pkg_src_fetch_var:
      - read PKGPATHs instead of Makefile filenames.
        In order to Makefiles from PKGPATH, PKGSRCDIR environment
        variable is used (/usr/pkgsrc by default).
      - TAB character is used as a fields separator instead of SPC

   pkg_micro_src_summary:
      - added options: -h|--help|-f|--fields
        -f|--fields is for specifying fields to be included
        to the summary, PKGNAME and PKGPATH by default

Version 0.4.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Wed,  9 Apr 2008 23:14:03 +0300

   ADDED: -f|--fields=<fields> option to pkg_src_fetc_var
   clean-ups
