.TH PKG_CMP_SUMMARY 1 "Feb 10, 2008" "" ""
.SH NAME
pkg_cmp_summary \- compares two summary files (pkg_summary(5) format)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI pkg_cmp_summary " [OPTIONS] pkg_summary1 pkg_summary2"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pkg_cmp_summary
compares package versions in two pkg_summary(5) files.
These files may be generated by pkg_info -X, pkg_src_summary(1)
and other utils.
Actually only PKGNAME fields (and optionally PKGPATH) are used
for comparison.
.P
Format of the results:
.br
  <R> [PKGPATH] <PKGBASE> <VER1> <VER2>
.br
where R is
.br
  -     present in the first file but absent in the second one (disappears)
  +     absent in the first file but present in the second one (appears/new)
  <NUM> more than one package with the same PKGBASE is in the first file
  =     versions are the same
  <     second file contains newer version
  >     second file contains earlier version
  ?     versions are incomparable (incorrect version, for example)
  !     versions are not equal (versions themselves are the same but
           CVS_CHECKSUMs are different)
.br
.P
PKGBASE is PKGNAME with version stripped,
VER1 and VER2 are package versions.
PKGPATH appears in output if -p option is specified.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B "-h|--help"
display help message

for comparing summaries for multi-variant packages
(PKGPATH=category/name:variable_assignments format of PKGPATH field)
