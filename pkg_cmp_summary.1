.Dt PKG_CMP_SUMMARY 1
.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg_cmp_summary
.Nd compares two summary files (pkg_summary.txt format)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar pkg_summary1 pkg_summary2 ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
compares files that contain summary information about packages
(pkg_summary.txt format).
These files may be generated by pkg_info -X, pkg_src_summary
or anything else.
Actually PKGNAME fields are compared only.
All PKGNAMEs are checked, i.e. versions are compared and
presense is checked.

Format of the results:

  <R> <PKGBASE> <VER1> <VER2>

where R is

  -     present in the first file but absent in the second one (disappears)
  +     absent in the first file but present in the second one (appears/new)
  <NUM> more than one package with the same PKGBASE is in the first file
  =     versions are the same
  <     second file contains more recent version (upgrade is possible)
  >     first file contains earlier version (downgrade is possible)
  ?     versions are incomparable (e.g. 1.2.3 vs. 20080101)

PKGBASE is PKGNAME with version stripped,
VER1 and VER2 are package versions. VER2 is present only if
   R is `<' or `>'
