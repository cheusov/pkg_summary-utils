Version 0.5.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 27 Apr 2008 14:37:46 +0300

   Lots of tasks from TODO are implemented.

   pkg_src_fetch_var:
      - minor fixes in comments
      - new options -h|--help for use message
      - new options -f|--fields|-v|--vars for specifying a list of fields
        to be generated. By default PKGNAME and PKPATH
        are generated as earlier versions did.

        Example:
          echo 'wip/distbb' | \
          pkg_src_fetch_var -f='PKGNAME PKGPATH DEPENDS BUILD_DEPENDS'

      - bmake '+=' operator is also supported

   pkg_src_summary:
      - new options -h|--help for use message
      - new options -f|--fields for specifying a list of fields
        to be generated. By default PKGNAME and PKPATH
        are generated as earlier versions did.
      - 'print-summary-data' pkgsrc target is not used anymore.
        Instead, variable's values are obtained directly by bmake.

        Side effect/incompatibility: NOTFOR and ONLYFOR are set to
        <empty_string> instead of 'any' string in case
        NOT_FOR_PLATFORM and ONLY_FOR_PLATFORM are not specified.

   pkg_micro_src_summary:
      - new options -f|--fields for specifying a list of fields
        to be generated. By default PKGNAME and PKPATH
        are generated as earlier versions did.

        Example:
          pkg_micro_src_summary -f 'PKGNAME PKGPATH DEPENDS BUILD_DEPENDS' \
                                   lang/lua wip/distbb
      - In case pkg_src_fetch_var failes pkg_micro_src_summary fallbacks
        to pkg_src_summary.

Version 0.4.6, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 13 Apr 2008 14:56:41 +0300

   fix for pkg_summary4view: doesn't depend on input fields order.
   fix for pkg_src_summary: PKGNAME and PKGPATH are printed first.

Version 0.4.5, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 13 Apr 2008 00:43:22 +0300

   Both pkg_micro_src_summary and pkg_src_summary generate
   nicely formatted bmake failures to stderr.
   (will be used by future versions of distbb)

Version 0.4.2, by Aleksey Cheusov, Wed,  9 Apr 2008 00:34:58 +0300

   pkg_src_fetch_var:
      - read PKGPATHs instead of Makefile filenames.
        In order to Makefiles from PKGPATH, PKGSRCDIR environment
        variable is used (/usr/pkgsrc by default).
      - TAB character is used as a fields separator instead of SPC

   pkg_micro_src_summary:
      - added options: -h|--help|-f|--fields
        -f|--fields is for specifying fields to be included
        to the summary, PKGNAME and PKGPATH by default
