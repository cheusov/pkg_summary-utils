pkg_bin_summary - wrapper for 'pkg_info -X' that outputs
  build information and installation information
  variables as well some special variables for installed
  or binary packages,
  e.g. ASSIGNMENTS (settings to build multivariant packages) and
  REQUIREDBY. By default it is equivalent to pkg_info -Xa.
USAGE: pkg_bin_summary -h
       pkg_bin_summary [OPTIONS] [-- [PKG_INFO_ARGS]] [packages...]
OPTIONS:
  -h                display this help
  -a <fields>       add to the output the specified fields,
                    fields are separated by space or comma
  -f <fields>       output only the specified fields,
                    fields are separated by space or comma
  -r <fields>       remove from output the specified fields,
                    fields are output only specified fields
  -e                does nothing if no packages were specified
  -k <algorithms>   generate checksums for binary packages
                    and make them a part of summary (FILE_CKSUM)
PKG_INFO_ARGS:
  Options passed to pkg_info(1) that default to -a.
  In addition to these options -X is always applied to pkg_info
  as well as -B if needed. "--" is required
  if PKG_INFO_ARGS is not empty.
Samples of use:
  pkg_bin_summary -f PKGNAME,PKGPATH,ASSIGNMENTS,DEPENDS,automatic
  pkg_bin_summary -a automatic,ASSIGNMENTS
  pkg_bin_summary -r 'DESCRIPTION REQUIRES PROVIDES' -- -u
  pkg_bin_summary -a automatic -r REQUIRES 'lib*'
