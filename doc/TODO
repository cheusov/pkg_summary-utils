TODO list and thoughts

pkg_src_summary:
 - replace -D with "deps" for building|deps for buildiing recursively
pkg_lint_summary -f:
 - one conflict file is enough per conflicting pair

pkg_subgraph_deps:
 - option for -r + BUILD_DEPENDS for top level and then DEPENDS only

pkg_summary2leaves:
  -n -- print PKGNAME
  -r -- print version

pkg_lint4view:

existing tools:

    pkg_uniq_summary:
       - -f for normal fields
       - reimplement -F via -f

    pkg_cmp_summary:
       - automatic removal of #-comments

    pkg_micro_src_summary:
       - support for DESCRIPTION and ALLDISTFILES
       - _sometimes_ it is enough to run bmake for cut off Makefile.

    pkg_src_summary:
       - new option for exit code 0 if everything was done successfully,
         1 otherwise

    pkg_summary4view:
       - another format for DEPENDS, BUILD_DEPENDS and CONFLICTS,
         (convertors for RHEL yum, Debian apt, OpenSolaris IPS)

    pkg_update_summary:
       - reimplement it using 'pkg_grep_summary -S FILE_NAME file'
         and...

    pkg_lint_summary:
         - checks for bad patterns like foobar<=1.1.1nb*
         - improve REQUIRES/PROVIDES checks, i.e. use
           PROVIDES from dependencies only
         - distfiles checksums
         - check binaries and their REQUIRES and analyse Makefile

new tools?
    - replacement for lintpkgsrc -m

    - (unsure) additional tool for fields reordering?

    - rfc822_to_summary and (?)debian_to_summary(?) for converting an
      information about Debian packages to pkg_summary(5) format.
      For pkg_online database server for Debian packages?

    - pkg_summary2INDEX
      pkg_summary2PKGDB

ANY IDEAS? LET ME KNOW
